# A Note on Motivation
These controllers have great hardware—they just need a little software love to shine.  This project provides custom DAW integration scripts for M-VAVE controllers, improving their functionality in music production environments where official support may be limited.

## Why Use These Scripts?
M-VAVE devices (like the SMK-37Pro) offer solid hardware with responsive keys, pads, and encoders—but without deeper DAW integration, their potential can feel untapped.

## Implemented features
* [SM-37Pro](./SM-37Pro/implemented.md)
* SMC-Pad - **Nothing, for now**

## Installation
Copy all files for corresponding controller into subfolder in:
* **MacOS** - ~/Documents/Bitwig\ Studio/Extensions/
* **Linux** - ~/Bitwig Studio/Extensions/
* **Windows** - %userprofile%\Documents\Bitwig Studio\Extensions\

## Note
Currently tested only in Linux Mint. 

## Debugging
If you encounter any problems, feel free to submit issue
To check extention logs, press "Ctrl+Enter" in BitWig and select "Show Control Script Console".

## Configuration
Refer to device specific instructions
Device name matching isn't implemented yet, so it have to be configured manually.
